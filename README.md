# goated

a minimal discord API wrapper

## features

- unintrusive
- automatically reads from .env with Client#env/1
- command registration

## why

When making discord-trolling and using discord.js, I found that their environments quickly became too bloated and complicated. That's why I'm making goated, to simplify the ecosystem even more.
